# 🎓 My First Solo Project (Bachelor's 1st Semester)

This was my **very first solo project** during the **1st semester** of my Computer Science Bachelor's journey. At the time, I was just starting out with programming and **hadn't learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** yet — so everything was built using basic logic, functions, and procedural code.

I’m proud of it because it marks the beginning of my journey as a developer. It's simple, raw, and full of learning moments. 🌱

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Only Python

## 🚧 What I Learned
- How to structure basic code logic
- Problem-solving with limited programming knowledge
- The importance of clean code (learned that the hard way 😅)

## 🔍 Notes
This project is intentionally kept in its original form — no OOP, no frameworks — to show my growth over time.

Thanks for checking it out! Feel free to explore, laugh at my early code, or leave suggestions. 😊
